# `main.bash`

A tiny framework for bash scripts.

`main.bash` simplifies common bash scripting needs, like parsing the command
line, and handling signals.

## Developing `main.bash`

### Building

There's nothing to build. Make changes directly. It's just [the one
file](main.bash).

### Testing

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core)
and [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck).
3. Run `make`.

## Using `main.bash`

### Installation

Save `main.bash`, and `source` it from your bash script. It's just
[the one file](main.bash).

### Usage

See the [`examples/`](examples/), or the detailed docs in [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).
